# End to End Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition
## Udacity Race Track



### Getting started

The udacity simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)


To run the code please run the following line of code

`python3 drive.py [MODEL_PATH]`

### Work

- The used model follows the NVIDIA's architecture following their paper. The implementation can be found in `network_model.py`
- The model was trained only on the training track and tested on the test track
- The model was trained using Google Colab and the work can be found in the notebook
